## Introduction

The `eos-transfer-monitoring-tool` is a Python-based application that aims to provide insights into data transfer statistics from CERN's EOS Report Logs. The tool extracts relevant information from log files, aggregates the data, and generates visualizations to help identify trends, bottlenecks, and potential issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

To install the `eos-transfer-monitoring-tool`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/eos-transfer-monitoring-tool.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd eos-transfer-monitoring-tool`
3. Install the required dependencies (if any)
4. Run the tool using the appropriate command

## Usage

To use the eos-transfer-monitoring-tool, follow these steps:

1. Collect EOS Report Log files.
2. Place your EOS Report Log files in the data directory.
3. Run the main script with the path to the directory containing the log files as an argument: `python main.py`.
4. The tool will extract, filter, parse, and aggregate the data transfer statistics from the log files.
5. Review the generated reports to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize data transfer performance.


The script will process the log files, generate aggregated data, and create visualizations in the output directory.

## Development

This project is not a standalone project and relies on data sources such as EOS Report Logs. As a result, further development on this project is limited. However, you can still contribute to the project by:

 - Reporting bugs or suggesting improvements
 - Providing feedback on the tool's functionality
 - Adding new features or enhancing existing ones
